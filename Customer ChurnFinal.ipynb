    "### Problem Statement: Predicting Customer Churn for SyriaTel\n",
    "`Customer Churn` refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's products or services. In telecommunications industry, churn occurs when a subscriber cancels their service, switches to a competitor, or stops engaging with the company altogether\n",
    "\n",
    "For Syrialtel, a telcom provider, high churn rates lead to significant revenue losses, increased customer acquisition costs, and a weakened market position.Retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn prediction a critical business priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Customer Churn:\n",
    "1. Revenue loss - Losing customers reduces recurring revenue, impacting overall profitability\n",
    "2. Higher Acquisition Costs - Acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existiong ones.\n",
    "3. Reputational Damage - High churn ratess may inidcate poor service quality,leading to negative word-of-mouth\n",
    "4. Reduced Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) - Frequent customer exits lower the long-tern revenue a company can generate from each user\n",
    "5. Operational Inefficiencies - constantly replacing lost customers requires continous marketing and sales efforts, increase costs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The goal is to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn in the near future. By analyzing patterns in customer behaviour, the company can implement targeted retetion strategies, such as personalized offers, improved customer support, or proactive engagement, to reduced churn and enhance customer loyalty"
